# Medicare_Fraud
Medical provider fraud is one of the biggest problems facing the US public healthcare system.
Medicare, one of the largest public insurance programs primarily for people aged 65 or older,
accounts for a majority of public healthcare spending and has been the target of many fraud
schemes.

This project is to investigate this fraud. A dataset is provided contains a sample of anonymized data for beneficiaries, as well as their inpatient and outpatient insurance
claims between Dec 2008 and Dec 2009. A separate table of health care provider flags show those who appear to have engaged in fraud. A data dictionary describing the fields in each table is also provided.

When a provider is flagged as committing potential fraud, all claims involving this provider are audited. This is an extremely costly, time consuming, and potentially adversarial
process. Thus, accurate identification of providers who should be targeted with an audit is of utmost importance to Medicare.
